Tripsy – Smart Travel Planner
Tripsy is an intelligent, user-centric travel planning app that recommends personalized itineraries based on mood, energy, budget, and travel goals. It is designed to bridge the gap between traditional logistics-focused trip planning and emotional, experience-driven travel.
